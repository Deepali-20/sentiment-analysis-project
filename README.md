A sentiment analysis project using Python, TF-IDF, and Logistic Regression.
# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on textual data such as product reviews or tweets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The goal is to classify text into three sentiment categories:
- **Positive** 
- **Negative** 
- **Neutral** 

The project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**, from **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation**, and provides insights through visualizations.
